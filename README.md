AlgoBuddy is an online algorithm visualizer that shows a variety of searching and sorting algorithms for computer science. On the homepage, you are greeted with a welcome message and can
navigate around the website using the nav bar located at the top of each page. Hovering over the icons on the nav bar and selecting an algorithm will take you to the algorithm's respective page. Within the
website, you have the ability to switch between dark and light mode, which will change the appearance of the website to either a brighter or darker tone.

Within each algorithm page, a preamble of the algorithm is listed at the top. Scrolling down, you will have access to a visualizer of the respective algorithm. Using the control bar
beneath the visualizer, you can adjust the speed of the visuals. You can also view specific steps by either using the "Previous", "Next", and "Play" buttons, or by scrolling through the
visual progress bar. Using the textboxes, you can edit the values of the array and, depending on the algorithm, change the target value. The "Reset" button can be used to reset the
animation.

Below the visualizer is the sample code of the algorithm. Using the drop-down menu on the top right, you can also change the language of the shown code to either Python, Java, C, or C++.
